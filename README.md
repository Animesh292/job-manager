### Deployment

https://jobpostmanager.netlify.app/

Used netlify to deploy this site on their servers where it is up and running. User's can view and experience the live preview of the site.
To deploy this site on netlify things were basic. Below are the steps provided -

1- Entered my browser and browsed for https://www.netlify.com and proceeded with login there as I already had an account.
2- Then clicked on an option Add new site, there I got a drop down where I saw github one which was like 'upload a already added project/import existing project'.
3- Then I clicked on it then it redirected me to github servers to authenticate me and there I logged in got back to netlify with message like authorized.
4- Then I got all the github repository showed up in netlify and I clicked on job-manager.
5- Then came the most crucial part which was configuring this repo for a live preview. There I got site name input which was desired by name I choose followed by netlify.com. Branch to deploy which was to default branch I had in my github which was master. Then Build settings like my base directory, build command, publish directory and functions directory if any. This time I added all the relevant to my project. Like base directory was my root /, build command npm start, publish directory as build. This was it everything was setup and I clicked on Deploy my_projectname button and it started building my project for live server preview.

Finally it says site deployed at https://jobpostmanager.netlify.app/ where I clicked and landed on the website. This turned out to be bravo.
